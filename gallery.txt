Big question comes! Pops right up in my head like a sudden building!
To be here, like this? Or... *poof*? To not be?

Which is best? My heart goes *thump-thump-thump*.
Is it Nobashi to just stay? To let the awful luck,
The mean things like a thousand little missiles, crash down, crash down on me?
Or take big action? Like... like the JSDF guns go *bang-bang-bang* against the giant shape from the bay?
Fight the giant sea of troubles? Maybe make it go away?
Maybe? Maybe not.

If I just... *poof*... like a little smoke cloud...
Sleep. Sleep? That's all?
To sleep. To end the heartaches, all the bumps and bruises life gives you,
Like tripping over rubble when a Kaiju foot just smashed the road.
That sleep ending everything? Oh, yes please! Super nice! A finish!

But... wait. In that sleep of *poof*?
Maybe... dreams come?
That's the scary part! That makes us stop!
What dreams come when you're gone? When you float away from this world,
Like a broken balloon? What kind of dark, unknown place do you go?
Maybe full of... things you can't see? Bigger than Godzilla?
Maybe like the bottom of the deep, dark ocean where the weirdest monsters sleep?
That thought! It makes you feel cold! Like an icy beam!

That's why we don't rush to *poof*!
We stand here! We carry the heavy bags of life's hard stuff!
We feel the little *zap-zap-zap* of pain every day!
Because we're scared! Scared of the place with no map!
The land you never come back from! Like being sent to Monster Island, maybe? Forever?

Thinking about it, thinking, thinking, thinking... it makes you slow down.
It makes brave plans, big brave ideas, turn yellow and soft,
Like old newspapers getting wet in the rain.
They don't happen! Action stops!
Like a giant robot, all powered up, but the pilot is just... thinking... thinking... thinking...
And the monster keeps stomping.

So... the bright energy gets dull.
The face looks sad.
Like... like the city after the roaring stops.
It is like that. Yes. That is the truth.
